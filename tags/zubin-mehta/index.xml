&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am zubin and this my personal website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Bombay and have stayed here for major part of my life. I graduated from IIT Bombay with masters in Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am building &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/what-is-zing42&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;zing42&lt;/a&gt; which is a command based messenger application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like solving complex problems, writing programs, coming up with (startup) ideas, making lists, appreciating colors and making plans for world domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy taking evening walks, drinking water and writing on whiteboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked extensively in the area of unstructured text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Bombay with my parents and my wife Shilpi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code of this website resides &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zubinmehta/47bin.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--This personal website project has been on my mind for a long time. This will be the place for me to catalog my ideas, code and personal life and findings.--&gt;

&lt;!--
After years of,

* writing on different platforms and walls
* scribbling thoughts in small pocket diaries
* seeing ideas and thoughts and questions that go nowhere
* saving world-changing links in various places
* expressing thoughts in one-liners

I decided to take matters into my hand to save our world, thus, this website.
--&gt;

&lt;!-- autogenerate list based on categories - take top 10 based on frequency --&gt;

&lt;!--
Here, I shall talk about the following and more:

* ideas
* programming-general
* python
* math
* startups
* opinions
* internet
* philosophy
* thoughts
* science
* even art
* daily-life
* recommendations
* technology
* web-technology
* tv-series
* lists
* existence
* surrealism
* machine-learning
* personal-experiences
* solving-problems
