Hi, I am zubin and this my personal website.

I grew up in Bombay and have stayed here for major part of my life. I graduated from IIT Bombay with masters in Chemistry.

Currently, I am building <a href="https://zing42.com" target="_blank">zing42</a> which is a command based messenger application.

I like solving complex problems, writing programs, coming up with (startup) ideas, making lists, appreciating colors and making plans for world domination.

I also enjoy taking evening walks, drinking water and writing on whiteboards.

I have worked extensively in the area of unstructured text.

I live in Bombay with my parents and my wife Shilpi.

The source code of this website resides <a href="https://github.com/zubinmehta/47bin.com" target="_blank">here</a>

<!--This personal website project has been on my mind for a long time. This will be the place for me to catalog my ideas, code and personal life and findings.-->


<!--
After years of,

* writing on different platforms and walls
* scribbling thoughts in small pocket diaries
* seeing ideas and thoughts and questions that go nowhere
* saving world-changing links in various places
* expressing thoughts in one-liners

I decided to take matters into my hand to save our world, thus, this website.
