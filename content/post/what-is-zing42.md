Command based messenger application.

zing42 is a project I have been working on for almost a year now.

While chatting with people you would be able to do much more than just chat using our wide array of slash "/commands". See below for examples.

[comment]: # (for eg. /uber, /pay, /cricket, /football, /nse, /poll, /bookamovieticket, /feedback, etc.)
[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)

At the heart of it, it is a mini programming language. It also incorporates some free notion of type-checking. We want to integrate with everything under the sun.


Following are a few examples to help you understand:

Many more things, actually.

You want a job (/getjob), you want a plumber (/plumber), you want a doctors opinion on chat (/doctor), you want to order a pizza (/pizza) or get the bloodbank's number(/bloodbank) --- its all just a command.  

If you have more ideas and if you think zing42 can help you or your organization, <a href="/contact/"> let me know.</a>

We are very excited to launch this. We should be android and web ready sometime in May, 2016 :)


------------------------------------------------

## Philosophy

Program your life. We want everyone who understand chat to do more over chat. Everyone should be able to program basic things in and around their life. Even companies, startups and just about any teams can use zing42 to program things for efficiency-nirvana and accountability.

I should be able to order a pizza by writing no more than 4-5 words. I should be able to know my historical record of gym visits in 2 words.

Communication is the backbone. Chat is the delivery medium. Our human language is filled with verbs and prepositions that mean a lot. Clubbing this with a lot of context and we can see more powerful ideas emerge. We want to build the legos and support more clever ideas -- 1 command and 1 line at a time.

## Faqs

### Where is the app, I cannot wait to try it ?

We are still in beta. We shall launch in May, 2016 (sorry no ios app yet).

### How do I build commands for zing42 ?

Our APIs are not yet public but I can work with you on this front and help you publish your command. <a href="/contact/">Contact me</a>.


### Why not just build on top of other chat platforms.

Looking at the current state of systems(no APIs), we decided to build one ourselves. We want to build the API for programmatic messaging alongwith providing hooks through the concept of commands.


### How are you different from other order aggregators out in the market ?

We are simply not one. We may integrate with certain things/companies but we are mostly just a tech platform that can integrate very well and have a cool fast interface to do stuff.  
Also, no human is sitting anywhere and replying to your demands or commands. Actually computers are answering your demands but they are foolish so you have to be a little more specific. But do not worry, we will guide you well.

[comment]: <> (Also, we are training computers to understand more of what you are saying. If you know what I mean!)


### But aren't you just like ...

Yes and no. Probably not but maybe. Who knows! There might be similarities, as chat bots and messengers and cute cat gifs are all the craze. z42 looks similar. It is hard not to think, who this is like. But we have a particular way in which we are taking this forward.
We want to keep building robust tech and see how it goes.


### There are so many commands, it is too overwhelming.

You need not use or even know most of the commands. With time you keep working with commands you can relate to and know them more and configure them to help you. Just like there are a million apps, but people only ever use 20!

So do not be overwhelmed :)  
/keepcalm and go one step at a time
