I often like to watch movies that just start and end. Everything is very stateless. Characters are easy and obvious. Conversations are simple but they matter. Small things happen. Nobody is killing anybody. Characters are close to real life characters. Trivial and mundane takes centre stage. Central characters are humans. Is artistic. Not much energy is sucked out of me while watching it. At last, life is simple.

Over the last 1-2 years, I watched bulk of the movies, I have watched in my life. Something changed and this happened. Not sure.

I am penning down a small list of such movies that I happened to like.

Here goes:

- Dazed and Confused
- Chasing Amy (1997)
- Dogma
- Pineapple Express
- Sideways
- Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)
- Ferris Bueller's Day Off
- Fast Times at Ridgemont High
- Mallrats (1995)
- My Cousin Vinny (1992)
- Midnight in Paris
- Before Midnight
- Before Sunrise
- Before Sunset
- Moonrise Kingdom (2012)
- Office Space (1999)
- Inside Out (2015)
- The Big Lebowski (1998)
- Lost in Translation (2003)
- The Darjeeling Limited (2007)
